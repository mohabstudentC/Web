    </aside>
</div>
<div class = "text">
    Accepting only about 150 out of thousands of applicants annually, STEM October is highly competitive. The school targets prospective students with demonstrated passion and aptitude for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
    Offering a unique system that focuses on scientific, mathematical, and technological fields, STEM schools target high-potential students who demonstrate strong academic skills.
    Classes in STEM October merge the punctual academic curricula with interesting collaborative environment, aiming to improve students’ social and presentational qualities. What makes STEM system unique is the fact of being student-based; that is, students are the center of the educational organization as it depends on students in explaining and searching their indicated concepts.
    The curriculum focuses on four main aspects which are: sciences, humanities, arts, and sports. Most classes provided are in STEM-based subjects such as chemistry, physics, biology, geology, pure mathematics, applied mathematics(mechanics), and technology. Students discuss the different topics of each subject in the classroom and then try to apply what they have learned in the labs with the guidance of our renowned faculty members. Regarding humanities, students take classes in languages: Arabic, English, German/French; Social Studies; Civics; and Religion. The purpose of these classes is to promote multi intellectuality and encourage students to share their ideas with their classmates. students are also required to enrol in one of three activities: Art, Library, Music to help them foster their sensational and artistic tastes. The last aspect is sports which is a mandatory course at STEM October due to its obvious importance in building students’ bodies and minds.
    The most attractive feature at STEM schools in the Capstone. Since its very first graduating class in 2014, student research has played an essential role in learning at STEM High School. Requirements for the STEM High School Diploma include the completion of five original engineering or experimental research project be distributed across five semesters while be exhibited and evaluated at the end of each one. Students work in teams and choose their projects based on the topic provided that responds to one of the Egyptian Grand Challenges. Capstones are graded during the “Capstone Exhibition” by a panel of university professors in the School of Sciences and School of Engineering. The selected Grand Challenges include but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Energy systems and Renewable resources</li>
<li>Water availability and treatment</li>
<li>Establishment of Industrial basis</li>
<li>Communication</li>
